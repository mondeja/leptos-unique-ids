# literal_as_id_attribute_value

### What it does

Check for literals passed to id attribute values.

### Why is this bad?

Passing a literal to an id attribute value can lead to issues with duplicate ids
in the DOM, which can cause unexpected behavior in the application. It is
recommended to use leptos-uniques-ids crate to generate unique ids instead.

### Known problems

Only checks for literals in the id attribute values of the `view!` macro.
Currently, it does not check it in Leptos builder syntax.

### Example

```rust,ignore
view! {
    <div id="my-identifier">Hello, world!</div>
}
```

Use instead:

```rust,ignore
use ids::Ids;

view! {
    <div id=Ids::MyIdentifier>Hello, world!</div>
}
```
