# tt_as_id_attribute_value

### What it does

Check for token trees passed as id attribute values (except for `Ids` enum variants).

### Why is this bad?

Passing `Ids` enum to an id attribute value is the only way to ensure that
`leptos-unique-ids` has to ensure that the id is unique in the DOM. Other token
trees must be avoided to prevent potential issues with duplicate ids in the DOM.

### Known problems

Only checks for tokens in the id attribute values of the `view!` macro.
Currently, it does not check it in Leptos builder syntax.

### Example

```rust,ignore
let foo = "my-identifier";

view! {
    <div id=foo>Hello, world!</div>
}
```

Use instead:

```rust,ignore
use ids::Ids;

view! {
    <div id=Ids::MyIdentifier>Hello, world!</div>
}
```
